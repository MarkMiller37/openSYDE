Description:
============
osy_cmd_line_flash_tool is a console application for updating one device with one HEX file.
It is a very simplified tool, compared to the other system based openSYDE tools. 
For all other use cases we highly recommend using the openSYDE GUI tool or SYDEsup, 
if you prefer using a command line tool.

Features:
* Setup CAN and connect to device
* Read device information
* Update device with one given HEX file
* Configuration through command line parameters
* Report progress to command line and exit with defined result codes

Non-Features (that are all supported in openSYDE GUI and SYDEsup):
* Only address based targets supported (no filebased support)
* Only CAN bus supported (no Ethernet support)
* Only local busses are supported (no routing)
* Only openSYDE protocol support
* Only HEX files support
* No security support (public/private key authentication)
* No device name check (HEX file device name vs. device name)
* No check if update is necessary

Platform:
=========
MS Windows (Win10 verified)

Requires:
=========
* STW CAN DLL to access CAN bus
* openSYDE device connected to CAN bus
* HEX file you want to flash

Getting started:
================
* Run with parameter -h to get a list of options
* Here is an example call for flashing "myapplication.hex" to device with node ID 1 and bitrate 1 MBit/s:
   osy_cmd_line_flash_tool.exe -i "C:\openSYDE\tool\STW_dlls\stwpeak2\stwpeak2.dll" -f "C:\Flashware\myapplication.hex" -n 1 -b 1000
* The tool prints some information about current progress to command line
* If something fails, check log file in ./Logs

Error codes:
============
osy_cmd_line_flash_tool can exit with the following codes:
   0     everything okay
   1     Caller requested help via -h
   10    Command line parsing error (e.g. no CAN DLL provided)
   20    Initialization failed (e.g. CAN initialization error or node ID misconfigured)
   30    Flashloader activation failed
   40    Reading device information failed (e.g. not connected to device)
   50    Error in update of device (e.g. could not read HEX file or could not communicate with server)
   60    Error when resetting device
Always check log file at ./Logs for details what happened!
